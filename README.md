# Motion Detection using OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV to detect motion in real-time using a webcam. It processes video frames, detects motion, and highlights moving objects with rectangles. The results are saved as an output video file (`motion_output.avi`) and individual frames where motion is detected (`motion_frame_{frame_number}.png`).

## Features

- Real-time motion detection using webcam input.
- Highlights detected motion with green rectangles.
- Saves processed frames where motion is detected as individual PNG images.
- Saves the entire motion-detected video as an `.avi` file.
- Simple exit by pressing the "q" key.
